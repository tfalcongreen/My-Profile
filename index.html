          <h2>My Interests In IT</h2>
            <p class="lead">
            <p class="lead">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular
               event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>
              <p>My interests in IT go back to some of my earliest memories at home. I remember our old dial-up connection beeping away 
              taking so long to produce even an image. Limewire and Torrents came next, accidently downloading viruses onto the family 
              computer while only trying to get a few songs on my 512mb mp3 player. While going to the local Trash & Treasure I would 
              often find old computers to take apart and see the insides, taking out the fans to connect to 9v batteries was always exciting.
              Later in life I found an interest in Graphic design, Sound engineering and small bits of coding through internet courses. The
              Graphic design was a creative outlet for me, as my pen to paper art skills are sub-par at best. Through an interest in live sound
              I continued to focus on the hardware element of IT, connecting technology and music, two of my loves. I began to delve into the
              world of coding, which brought me to this course.</p>
            <p class="lead">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
              <p>I chose RMIT as Melbourne is one of my favourite cities in all of Australia. The hope is once my Bachelor's commences I will do a
                 semester on campus in the city. RMIT was offered through OUA I will be able to study in a more flexible way compared to being 100%
                 on campus.</p>
            <p class="lead">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
              <p>I aim to learn more about the wide world of IT during my studies, eventually positioning myself in such a way as to gain employment
                 within the industry. I hope to find my place within the broad world that IT is.</p>

          <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
          <p class="lead">
                    The job listing I found was for <strong>Technology Lead</strong> with an SaaS company on the Gold Coast. The Position calls for 
                    someone who has 10 years of experience in Software Development with management experience to match. The role involves several 
                    programs which will likely be used as work commences. These include <strong>AWS, PHP, Java and React</strong>. The succesful applicant
                    must have experience with a "start-up" or similair business venture. On top of the Technical and Managerial Skills they must
                    have an artistic flair, as the position will involve making decisions concerned with design and architechture.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Currently my experience is only limitied to cursory studies in coding and graphic design. Neither of these are accredited by any institution and my experience
                    is less than two years in each of the fields. To Follow the path of this career I would need to continue my study to attain a 
                    Bachelor's of IT from RMIT, in which time I would hope to network with some career professionals and attain a Entry level position 
                    in a start-up endeavour. After staying with a particular company for a number of years I would progress to Tech Lead, a promotion 
                    I would keep for a minimum of 10 years. During this time I would hone my skills and gather experience in hands-on coding, design 
                    and team management. After this time I will have accrued enough knowledge to approach the technology job market with a pragmatic 
                    and holistic approach which this role requires.</p>

                <p class="lead">What do the results of these tests mean for you?</p>
                  <p>After taking these tests I can summise that tests such as these can produce varying results depening on the questions
                     asked, for example in the Myers-Briggs Index I showed signs of Introversion while the Big 5 Test pointed my personality
                     toward more Extroverted traits. Having taken these tests before, which turned a completely different result, I can assume
                     that either the test results change as the individual grows and adapts to different personalitys or that one frame of mind
                     may lead to different resuts than another eg. tired, stressed, hungover. In any case, these tests must be taken with skeptisism
                     and not as the sole arbier of personality.</p>
                              
                <p class="lead">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p>
                     <p>While these tests may help those discover more about their personality, or reinforce their already held beliefs, care must
                        be taken to recognise the cookie cutter format of these tests. Conversely, these tests may garner some confidence in an
                        individual, allowing them to read and recognise patterns in their group work or leadership style, allowing them to further
                        develop theses skills.
                    
                <p class="lead">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</p>
                     <p>As mentioned before, not too much faith should be put in a simple online test to build a personality profile. When forming a 
                        team, many variables can effect the success or failure of the working relationships. While they aren't perfect, these personality 
                        tests may open a dialog, in which team members may express their preferences related to group work, mangement styles and 
                        how they prefer to absorb information.</p>

          <h2>Project Idea</h2>
          <h2>Internet Service Consulting</h2>
          <p class="lead">Overview</p>
                          <p>For consumers today there are many options for Internet delivery types, Service Providers
                          and hardware. My project is to take the guesswork out of the consumer's hands and streamline
                          the connection process. Stable internet access is no longer a luxury, it has become one of
                          the most necessary tools for laymen and internet professionals alike. ISP's provide some of 
                          the tools to figure out the right internet service, but none confidently compare the connection
                          right to the person's premises. This project aims, through the use of existing and new technology,
                          to connect the user to the most stable, cost effective and fastest internet provider that is 
                          available to them.</p>

          <p class="lead">Motivation<p/>
                          <p>With over 400,000 new NBN connections alone since the beginning of 2020<a href="https://bit.ly/3d911zq">link</a>
                          Australians are more connected than ever, but how many of these customers are actually happy with 
                          their service? A survey by Choice.com.au, showed that <strong>53%</strong> of the respondents faced issues with
                          their service in the 6 months prior to the <a href="https://bit.ly/2CnrcWn">study</a>. With embarrasing 
                          figures such as these, consumers need more information and assistance finding the proper connection. 
                          Using a Raspberry Pi with connection to each of the service providers, a technician could assist a customer
                          to test each of the options, as well as find the best placement for the modem inside the premesis. No longer
                          will consumers be forced to rely on empty speed guarantee's from ISP's and prices they shouldn't have to pay.</p>
         
            
          <p class="lead">Description</p>
                          <p>This project will rely on a number of technologies to test and compare connections and a user interface for 
                          consumers to access the service through. After recieveing a prototype, custom printed Raspberry Pi with multiple
                          Sim slots,modems, an LCD interface and an antenna fitted, the process of setting up the software would commence. The Pi 
                          will be programmed to read out the names of each different ISP and a "speed-test" style health meter. The Technican
                          will move from room to room in the house or business, to download a small packet of information from each of the providers.
                          These results will read in real time on the screen for transparency with customer, as well as being transferred to a server
                          to hold the information for later use and comparison. A full breakdown of the results will also be sent to the customer with
                          detailed information as well a easy to read "colour map" of the premesis, a zoned grid of the floor plan to simply define the
                          places in which the connection is most stable. Once the customer is happy with a suitable ISP, they can use the Project's 
                          interface to access their desired plan. 
                          The Project's interface will be a simple html format website for customers to simply 
                          book an appointment with a technician. Through the website they will also be able to view the history of testing within the 
                          Project, which will be updated in real time as more and more consultations occur. The website will be managed using private 
                          servers as the blueprint's of houses may be liable to attack from criminals. Hosting the servers within the company protects 
                          the information gathered as cyber-attacks are becoming more common. The servers will be encrypted with the highest possible 
                          security.
                          While the Project is aimed at the individual consumer, the service will be available to real estate offices to offer a blueprint 
                          of the connectivity of the premesis. This is especially important for tech oriented businesses to aid them in choosing 
                          the right lease for their internet needs. The product is highly scalable without the need for the technology to change.
                          Whether for Individuals or Businesses, this Product is highly desireable for consumers to quickly and conscientiously choose
                          an internet service, which in a tech driven world, is becoming more of a necessity.</p>
                       
            
          <p class="lead">Tools and Technologies</p>-
                          <p>The tools required to complete this project are a mix of hardware and software, each element will be proprietary in nature and 
                          custom made for the service. The hardware needed will be a custom printed Raspberry Pi with several modems and Sim-slots
                          capable of connecting to multiple service providers, both broadband, 4g and 5g, simultaneously. An antennae will be fixed to 
                          measure the signals from each room and an LCD screen will be fitted to return the results to the operating technician. Software
                          required will consist of basic website development tools such as HTML, CSS, JS. They will be compiled in a repository at Github.com.
                          The "Colour-map" will be created with a combination of the Adobe suite tools like PS, AI and other 3d modeling tools such as Blender.</p>
                    
          <p class="lead">Outcome</p>
                          <p>If this project is successful, consumers will have choice to attain a stronger connection to the internet as well as the world
                          around them. This project will not only aid individuals in gaining better networks but also businesses as well. through the implementation
                          of the technologies mentioned, finally there will be no excuse for a poor connection.</p>
