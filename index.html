          <h2>My Interests In IT</h2>
            <p class="lead">
            <p class="lead">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular
               event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>
              <p>My interests in IT go back to some of my earliest memories at home. I remember our old dial-up connection beeping away 
              taking so long to produce even an image. Limewire and Torrents came next, accidently downloading viruses onto the family 
              computer while only trying to get a few songs on my 512mb mp3 player. While going to the local Trash & Treasure I would 
              often find old computers to take apart and see the insides, taking out the fans to connect to 9v batteries was always exciting.
              Later in life I found an interest in Graphic design, Sound engineering and small bits of coding through internet courses. The
              Graphic design was a creative outlet for me, as my pen to paper art skills are sub-par at best. Through an interest in live sound
              I continued to focus on the hardware element of IT, connecting technology and music, two of my loves. I began to delve into the
              world of coding, which brought me to this course.</p>
            <p class="lead">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
              <p>I chose RMIT as Melbourne is one of my favourite cities in all of Australia. The hope is once my Bachelor's commences I will do a
                 semester on campus in the city. RMIT was offered through OUA I will be able to study in a more flexible way compared to being 100%
                 on campus.</p>
            <p class="lead">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
              <p>I aim to learn more about the wide world of IT during my studies, eventually positioning myself in such a way as to gain employment
                 within the industry. I hope to find my place within the broad world that IT is.</p>

          <h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
          <p class="lead">
                    The job listing I found was for <strong>Technology Lead</strong> with an SaaS company on the Gold Coast. The Position calls for 
                    someone who has 10 years of experience in Software Development with management experience to match. The role involves several 
                    programs which will likely be used as work commences. These include <strong>AWS, PHP, Java and React</strong>. The succesful applicant
                    must have experience with a "start-up" or similair business venture. On top of the Technical and Managerial Skills they must
                    have an artistic flair, as the position will involve making decisions concerned with design and architechture.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Currently my experience is only limitied to cursory studies in coding and graphic design. Neither of these are accredited by any institution and my experience
                    is less than two years in each of the fields. To Follow the path of this career I would need to continue my study to attain a 
                    Bachelor's of IT from RMIT, in which time I would hope to network with some career professionals and attain a Entry level position 
                    in a start-up endeavour. After staying with a particular company for a number of years I would progress to Tech Lead, a promotion 
                    I would keep for a minimum of 10 years. During this time I would hone my skills and gather experience in hands-on coding, design 
                    and team management. After this time I will have accrued enough knowledge to approach the technology job market with a pragmatic 
                    and holistic approach which this role requires.</p>
